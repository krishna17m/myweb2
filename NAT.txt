for deployment let's find out right plugin and use it

install publish over ssh plugin

fdsf

this is vijays 2nd setup
we can detach from one ec2 and attach to other ec2

how do you give internet access to private subnet 
we have to configure NAT instance or NAT gw
NAT is network address translation
it is used to configure secure internet access to the servers in pvt subnet
NAT instance is normalinstance configured with NATing
It has some additional configuration for NATTIN

In which subnet we need to put NAT instance
NAT instance must reside in public subnet with public or elastic IP
NAT instance is IAAS, NAT gw is PAAS

NAT instance :-

1)Launch NAT instance from EC2 it is same like normal instance but we need to chose diff AMI

chose private route tables and add it to NAT
before we do this configuration we must disable source and destination check for NAT instance

AWS has default source and destination check on all ec2 instances
i.e when a traffice is initiated from ec2 the source of the traffic should be ec2
otherwise this traffice is blocked by aws 

diabling source destincation check on NAT instance
